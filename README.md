## Planned features

### From top to down - if nothing below is specified, play what's above.
1. General overworld (explore) music
2. Weather-specific tracks
3. Time-specific tracks
2. Region-specific (with "biome" grouping)
3. Culture-specific music in towns 
4. Interior-specific (tileset, regex and/or publican race)

### Others:
- Variable silence in between tracks (selectable timer type)
- Event-based (cell visit, quest finished, blessings etc.)
- Possibly, in the future: combat music (based on BMS/BMSR take)
